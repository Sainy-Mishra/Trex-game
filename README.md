# Trex-game
<h3>In the game, players control a running T-Rex dinosaur that must avoid obstacles such as cacti and birds by jumping over them. The longer you survive, the faster the game becomes, increasing the challenge. The goal is to run as far as possible without hitting any obstacles. It's a minimalist game with monochromatic visuals, reminiscent of classic arcade games, and serves as a fun distraction</h3>
